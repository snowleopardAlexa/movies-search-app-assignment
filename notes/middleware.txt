MIDDLEWARE

Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue". Middleware lies between an operating system and the application running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.
